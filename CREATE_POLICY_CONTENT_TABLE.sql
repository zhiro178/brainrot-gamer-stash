-- üìã CREATE POLICY CONTENT TABLE FOR ADMIN EDITING
-- This enables admins to edit privacy policy and terms of service content

-- 1. Drop table if exists to start fresh
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS policy_content CASCADE;

-- 2. Create policy_content table
CREATE TABLE policy_content (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- 'privacy-policy' or 'terms-of-service'
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subtitle TEXT,
    content JSONB NOT NULL, -- Store sections as JSON array
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_by VARCHAR(255) -- email of admin who last updated
);

-- 3. Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_policy_content_type ON policy_content(policy_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_policy_content_updated_at ON policy_content(updated_at);

-- 4. Create trigger to auto-update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_policy_content_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_policy_content_timestamp
    BEFORE UPDATE ON policy_content
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_policy_content_timestamp();
