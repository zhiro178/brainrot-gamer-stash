## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Removed TopUp Promotional Text

- **Fix**: Removed the promotional text from the homepage TopUpModal section

### 2. ✅ Fixed Admin Not Found Error
- **Issue**: When creating tickets, system showed "admin not found" error
- **Root Cause**: System was trying to query `auth.users` table which isn't accessible
- **Fix**: 
  - Simplified admin message creation to use current user ID with `is_admin: true` flag
  - Removed complex admin user lookup that was causing failures
  - Both user and admin messages are now created in the same ticket automatically

### 3. ✅ Fixed Admin Tickets Not Leading to Chat
- **Issue**: In admin panel, clicking "Open Chat" on tickets didn't work properly
- **Root Cause**: Component was depending on `selectedTicket` state that wasn't being set
- **Fix**:

### 4. ✅ Fixed Category Editing on Second Page
- **Issue**: Category editing on game page (second page) didn't update and clicked off when clicking anywhere
- **Root Cause**: Event propagation conflicts between card click and edit overlay
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper event propagation stopping with `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`
  - Wrapped AdminEditOverlay in a div with event handling
  - Added localStorage persistence for category changes

### 5. ✅ Fixed Catalog Editing Persistence
- **Issue**: When editing catalog items on third page, old values returned after leaving and coming back
- **Root Cause**: Component state was reset on navigation, no persistence
- **Fix**: 
  - Added localStorage persistence for catalog items
  - Items are saved automatically when edited
  - Items are loaded from localStorage on component mount
  - Uses unique keys per game/category combination

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Persistence System
- **Category Data**: Stored in localStorage as 'game-data'
- **Catalog Items**: Stored per game/category as `catalog-items-{gameId}-{categoryId}`
- **Auto-save**: useEffect hooks automatically save changes
- **Auto-load**: Components check localStorage on initialization

- **Click Handling**: Simplified button interactions
- **Dialog Management**: Improved dialog state management

### Admin System Fixes
