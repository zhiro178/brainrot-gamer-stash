## Auto-Message System Fixed âœ…

**Problem**: When customers created tickets, both the customer and admin were sending auto-messages.

**Solution**: Modified `TopUpModal.tsx` to only send admin welcome messages with the specific template:
```
Hello! Thanks for reaching out. Your top-up request for $[amount] USD has been received.
A support team member will review your request and send payment instructions shortly.
Please stay in this chat for updates.
```

**Changes Made**:
- Removed automatic user messages in both crypto and gift card flows
- Replaced multiple messages with single admin welcome message
- Uses exact template requested by user

## Balance Update System Enhanced ðŸ’°

**Problem**: User balance wasn't updating when tickets were approved.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Event Listeners**: 
   - Added both specific and generic balance refresh events
   - Added `useCallback` for `fetchUserBalance` to prevent infinite re-renders
   - Fixed dependency array in `useEffect`

2. **Improved Balance Fetching**:
   - Fixed query to not use `.single()` which was causing errors
   - Added better error handling for missing balance records
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

3. **Multiple Refresh Mechanisms**:
   - Primary: Custom balance-updated event with user ID
   - Secondary: Generic refresh-balance event
   - Fallback: Page reload after 5 seconds (increased from 3)

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Added toast notification when balance updates
   - Added console logging for debugging

## Files Modified

1. **client/src/components/TopUpModal.tsx**
   - Removed duplicate user messages
   - Standardized admin welcome message template

2. **client/src/pages/Index.tsx**
   - Enhanced balance refresh event listeners
   - Improved `fetchUserBalance` with `useCallback`
   - Added toast notifications for balance updates

3. **client/src/components/CryptoTopupList.tsx**
   - Added additional balance refresh event dispatch
   - Increased fallback reload timeout

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Create a new top-up request - should only see admin welcome message
2. Approve a request as admin - balance should update immediately with toast notification
3. Check browser console for debug logs confirming event dispatch and reception

## Expected Behavior

- **New Tickets**: Only admin sends welcome message with standard template
- **Approval**: Balance updates within 1-2 seconds with visual confirmation
- **Fallback**: Page reloads after 5 seconds if events fail

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Persistence System
- **Category Data**: Stored in localStorage as 'game-data'
- **Catalog Items**: Stored per game/category as `catalog-items-{gameId}-{categoryId}`
- **Auto-save**: useEffect hooks automatically save changes
- **Auto-load**: Components check localStorage on initialization

### Event Handling Improvements
- **Event Propagation**: Proper stopPropagation() calls to prevent conflicts
- **Click Handling**: Simplified button interactions
- **Dialog Management**: Improved dialog state management

### Admin System Fixes
- **Message Creation**: Simplified to avoid auth.users table queries
- **Chat Integration**: Direct ticket-to-chat mapping
- **Error Handling**: Removed points of failure in admin lookup

## User Experience Improvements:
- âœ… Tickets create successfully without admin errors
- âœ… Category edits persist across navigation
- âœ… Catalog item edits persist across navigation  
- âœ… Admin chat opens immediately from tickets
- âœ… Edit overlays work properly without clicking off
- âœ… Cleaner homepage without promotional text

All reported issues have been resolved with robust implementations that improve both user and admin experiences.
