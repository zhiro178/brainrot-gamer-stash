## 🗑️ **Fixed Wipe Functionality**

### **Problem**: 
- Wipe function reported success but didn't actually delete tickets
- Using non-existent RPC functions and ineffective deletion methods
- No detailed feedback about what was actually deleted

### **Solution**: 
**Completely rewrote the wipe function** with comprehensive deletion logic:

#### **New Multi-Step Wipe Process:**

**Step 1: Inventory Phase**
```javascript
// Get all tickets first to count them
const { data: allTickets } = await supabase
  .from('support_tickets')
  .select('id, category');
```

**Step 2: Messages Deletion**
```javascript
// Delete all ticket messages first (cascade deletion)
const { error: messagesError, count: messagesCount } = await supabase
  .from('ticket_messages')
  .delete()
  .in('ticket_id', allTickets.map(t => t.id));
```

**Step 3: Tickets Deletion**
```javascript
// Delete all support tickets
const { error: ticketsError, count: ticketsCount } = await supabase
  .from('support_tickets')
  .delete()
  .in('id', allTickets.map(t => t.id));
```

**Step 4: Cleanup Phase**
```javascript
// Double-check and clean up any remaining records
await supabase.from('ticket_messages').delete().neq('id', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
await supabase.from('support_tickets').delete().neq('id', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
```

#### **Enhanced Feedback System:**

**Success Message:**
- **Before**: "System Wiped Successfully"
- **After**: "System Wiped Successfully ✅" - "All tickets and messages have been permanently deleted! Removed X tickets and Y messages from the system."

**Partial Success:**
- **New**: "Partial Wipe Completed ⚠️" - Shows exactly what was deleted and what errors occurred

**Failure Message:**
- **Before**: "Wipe Failed"
- **After**: "Wipe Failed ❌" - Includes specific error details

#### **Comprehensive Coverage:**
- ✅ **Support tickets** - All general support requests
- ✅ **Purchase tickets** - All purchase orders and delivery tracking
- ✅ **Top-up tickets** - All crypto and gift card top-up requests
- ✅ **Ticket messages** - All chat messages associated with tickets
- ✅ **Cleanup pass** - Catches any remaining orphaned records
