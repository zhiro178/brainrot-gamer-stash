# Purchase System Implementation

## Overview
The purchase system has been successfully implemented to check user balance, deduct costs, and create support tickets with chat functionality for purchases.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Balance Verification
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/Catalog.tsx` - `handlePurchase` function
- **Functionality**: 
  - Checks if user is logged in and email verified
  - Fetches current user balance from `user_balances` table
  - Validates sufficient funds before allowing purchase

### ✅ Cost Deduction
- **Process**:
  1. Calculates new balance (current balance - item price)
  2. Updates `user_balances` table with new balance
  3. Dispatches UI refresh events to update navbar balance immediately
  4. Caches new balance in localStorage for instant display

### ✅ Support Ticket Creation
- **Ticket Details**:
  - **Category**: `purchase`
  - **Subject**: `Purchase Claim - {item name}`
  - **Status**: `open`
  - **Initial Message**: Purchase details and delivery request

### ✅ Chat System Integration
- **Automatic Messages**:
  1. **User Message**: Confirms purchase with remaining balance
  2. **Admin Message**: Payment confirmation and delivery timeline
- **Chat Interface**: Full ticket chat functionality in "My Tickets" page

### ✅ UI Integration
- **Purchase Flow**:
  - Success toast with purchase details and new balance
  - Error handling for insufficient funds
  - Login/verification prompts for unauthorized users
- **Ticket Management**:
  - Purchase tickets display with shopping bag icon
  - Special styling and categorization
  - Amount extraction from ticket subject

## Technical Implementation

### Database Tables Used

2. **`client/src/pages/Tickets.tsx`**: Added purchase ticket support with ShoppingBag icons
3. **`client/src/pages/Admin.tsx`**: Added purchase category handling

### Balance Update Events
- `user-balance-updated`: Triggers navbar balance refresh
- `balance-updated`: General balance change notification
- localStorage caching for instant UI updates

## User Experience Flow

1. **Browse Items**: User views catalog items with prices
2. **Attempt Purchase**: Click purchase button on desired item
3. **Authentication Check**: System verifies login and email verification
4. **Balance Verification**: System checks if user has sufficient funds
5. **Purchase Processing**: 
   - Deducts cost from balance
   - Creates support ticket
   - Adds chat messages
   - Shows success notification
6. **Ticket Management**: User can track order in "My Tickets" with full chat support

## Admin Experience

- **Ticket Overview**: Purchase tickets appear in admin panel with shopping bag icons
- **Chat System**: Admins can communicate with customers about delivery
- **Balance Management**: Existing admin tools for user balance oversight

## Error Handling

- **Insufficient Funds**: Clear error message with shortfall amount
- **Authentication**: Login/registration prompts

- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms and error notifications

## Security Features
