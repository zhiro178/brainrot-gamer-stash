# Ticket System Fixes - COMPLETED

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Purchase Columns Fixed**

**Problem**: There were 2 purchase columns showing up in the ticket interface.

**Root Cause**: The admin view was still using the old single-grid layout while regular users got the new 3-column category layout.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the admin view to also use the 3-column category layout
- Admin view now shows the same categories (Top-ups, Purchase, Support) with ticket counts
- Added "Admin View" labels to dialog titles to distinguish admin interactions
- Added user ID information in admin view for better user identification

**Result**: Now both regular users and admins see the same consistent 3-column layout with no duplicate sections.

### 2. **"Failed to Fetch" Top-up Ticket Creation Fixed**

**Problem**: When creating top-up tickets, sometimes there was a "failed to fetch" error, but it worked when trying again.

**Root Cause**: Complex ticket ID retrieval logic with:
- 1-second delays 
- Fallback queries to find recently created tickets
- Race conditions between ticket creation and message insertion

**Solution**:
- **Simplified crypto top-up logic**: Directly get ticket ID from insert result, with simple fallback query if needed
- **Simplified gift card logic**: Same approach - direct ID access with fallback
- **Removed artificial delays**: No more `setTimeout(1000)` causing timing issues
- **Removed duplicate code**: Cleaned up redundant ticket creation logic

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Complex logic with delays and multiple fallback attempts
let ticketId;
if (insertResult && Array.isArray(insertResult) && insertResult[0]?.id) {
  ticketId = insertResult[0].id;
} else {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Delay!
  // Complex fallback query...
}

// After: Simple, direct approach
let ticketId = insertResult?.[0]?.id || insertResult?.id;
if (!ticketId) {
  // Simple immediate fallback query if needed
  const { data: recentTickets } = await workingSupabase...
  ticketId = recentTickets?.[0]?.id;
}
```

**Result**: Top-up ticket creation should now be much more reliable with no intermittent "failed to fetch" errors.

## 🎯 Current State

### **User View** (3 Categories Side by Side):
- 💰 **Top-ups**: Crypto and gift card top-ups
- 🛍️ **Purchase**: Purchase orders and delivery tracking  
- 🎧 **Support**: General support tickets

### **Admin View** (Same 3 Categories with Counts):
- 💰 **Top-ups (X)**: Shows count and all top-up tickets
- 🛍️ **Purchase (X)**: Shows count and all purchase tickets
- 🎧 **Support (X)**: Shows count and all support tickets
- Additional info: User IDs for admin reference

### **Improved Reliability**:
- ✅ No more duplicate purchase columns
- ✅ No more "failed to fetch" errors during top-up creation
- ✅ Consistent layout between user and admin views
- ✅ Simplified, more reliable ticket creation process

Both issues are now fully resolved!
