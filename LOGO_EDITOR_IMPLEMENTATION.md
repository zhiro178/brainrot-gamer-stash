# Logo Editor Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive logo editor that allows admin users to customize the "592 Stock" logo appearance in the navbar. This includes editing the text content and various font styling options.

## Features

### Logo Customization Options
- **Logo Text**: Change the actual text displayed (default: "592 Stock")
- **Font Size**: 10 different size options from Extra Small to 6X Large
- **Font Weight**: 9 weight options from Thin to Black
- **Font Family**: 5 font families (Sans Serif, Serif, Monospace, Cursive, Fantasy)
- **Colors**: 14 color options including gradients and solid colors
- **Text Decoration**: None, Underline, Line Through, Overline
- **Letter Spacing**: 6 spacing options from Tighter to Widest
- **Text Transform**: Normal, Uppercase, Lowercase, Capitalize

### Admin Access
- Only available to admin users (zhirocomputer@gmail.com or ajay123phone@gmail.com)
- Only visible when admin mode is enabled
- Appears as an "Edit Logo" button next to the logo in the navbar

## How to Use

### Accessing the Logo Editor
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Make sure admin mode is enabled
3. Look for the "Edit Logo" button next to the logo in the navbar
4. Click the button to open the logo editor dialog

   - Changes are automatically saved to localStorage
   - Logo updates immediately across the site

4. **Reset to Default**:

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
- `AdminLogoEditor.tsx`: Main editor component with comprehensive styling options

### Components Modified
- `Navbar.tsx`: 
  - Added logo style state management
  - Integrated AdminLogoEditor component
  - Made logo text and styling dynamic
  - Updated login/register dialog text to use dynamic logo name

### Persistence
- Logo settings are saved in `localStorage` under the key `admin_logo_style`
- Settings persist across browser sessions
- Default values are used if no saved settings exist

### Dynamic Integration
The logo editor integrates with existing components:
- Navbar logo text updates in real-time
- Login dialog title uses dynamic logo name ("Login to [Logo Name]")
- Register dialog description uses dynamic logo name ("Join [Logo Name] to start trading")
